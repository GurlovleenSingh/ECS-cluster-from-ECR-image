# ECS-cluster-from-ECR-image
Running a ECR Image on ECS cluster with Task definition

Step 1: make sure your image is ready in ECR repository
Step 2: Create ECS Task Definition
Now, create an ECS task definition to define your application's requirements and settings:
Go to ECS Console: Navigate to the Amazon ECS console.

Create Task Definition:
***************************************

Click on "Task Definitions" in the left sidebar.
Click on "Create new Task Definition" and select a launch type (EC2 or Fargate).
Configure Task Definition:
*******************************************

Enter a name and optional task role.
Under "Task execution IAM role," choose an existing role or create a new one with the necessary permissions.

Configure container definitions:
*******************************************
Container name: Name your container.
Image: Enter the ECR image URI (e.g., <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<repository_name>:latest).
Memory and CPU: Specify resource limits.
Port mappings: Define the ports your container uses.
Save the Task Definition: Review the configuration and click "Create".

Step 3: Create ECS Cluster (if not already created)
If you haven't created an ECS cluster yet, follow these steps:
Go to ECS Console: Navigate to the Amazon ECS console.
Create Cluster:
Click on "Clusters" in the left sidebar.
Click on "Create Cluster" and choose a cluster template (EC2 Linux, EC2 Windows, or Fargate).
Configure Cluster:
Choose a networking mode (default or custom VPC).
Optionally, configure instance types, EC2 instance AMIs, and other advanced settings.
Create the Cluster: Review and create your ECS cluster.

STEP 4: CREATE ECS SERVICE
Now, create an ECS service to manage and maintain a specified number of instances of a task definition in your cluster:
Go to ECS Console: Navigate to the Amazon ECS console.
Create Service:
Click on "Clusters" in the left sidebar, then click on your ECS cluster.
Click on "Create" and select "Service".
Configure Service:
Choose a launch type (EC2 or Fargate).
Select the task definition and revision.
Configure cluster VPC and subnets.
Optionally, configure service auto scaling, load balancing, and other settings.
Set Desired Number of Tasks: Specify the number of tasks you want to run.
Create Service: Review your configurations and click "Create Service".

Step 5: Access Your Application
Once your ECS service is running, you can access your application through:
Load Balancer: If you configured a load balancer, use its DNS name.
Public IP/Instance IP: If using EC2 launch type and not using a load balancer, use the public IP or instance IP directly.
Summary
This step-by-step guide covers the process of deploying a Docker image from Amazon ECR onto an Amazon ECS cluster. Adjustments may be needed based on specific requirements such as networking, security groups, and application dependencies.
